This is Tr'ondëk, also known as Klondike or Solitaire. 
The classic game was recreated using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript over the course of a week. 

The card game, Klondike, was said to have been named after the Tr'ondëk (The Klondike River), located in the Yukon Territory in North-Western Canada. 
Tr'ondëk means "hammer-rock river" in the Hän language, which is spoken by the First Nation Tr'ondëk Hwëch'in people.
